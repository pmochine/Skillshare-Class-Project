# Hello there :)

This was my first time testing the Web Framework Django that is based on the programming language Python.

I made this for my class at Skillshare. 

The goal is to create a simple hello world file in the language you want to learn. After that you are going to upload to a repository so you can show the world that you are going to be a future Web Developer!

Enjoy :)
