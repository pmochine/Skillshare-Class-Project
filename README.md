# Skillshare Class Project - My first time with Django

![My Skillshare class](img/EndClassCover.jpg)

## About this repository

This was my first time testing the Web Framework Django that is based on the programming language Python.

I made this for my class at Skillshare. 

The class project goal is to create a simple hello world file in the language you want to learn. After that you are going to upload to a repository so you can show the world that you are going to be a future Web Developer!

Enjoy :)

p.S. if you want to learn how to create Django. You need to install python first. Here is a good tutorial for mac users: https://appdividend.com/2018/03/28/how-to-install-django-in-mac/
