# Skillshare Class Project - My first time with Django

![My Skillshare class](img/EndClassCover.jpg)

## About this repository

This was my first time testing the Web Framework Django that is based on the programming language Python.

I made this for my class at Skillshare. If you want to watch it [here you go](https://skl.sh/2QwbMls) (btw you get 2 free months as well).

The class project goal is to create a simple hello world file in the language you want to learn. After that you are going to upload to a repository so you can show the world that you are going to be a future Web Developer!

Enjoy :)
